Waste management is when you have many, let's say, bottles and things that pollute a lot because they are bad for the environment and that and cause many problems, for example, when you vote for a plastic bottle and leave it freely unused, sunshine  It is filling the world with garbage and that I do not know, that is not inferred, it is so fast around the world since a plastic bottle can take up to 1000 years to dispose of. Therefore, this would literally last a long time.  So, therefore, a lot and a lot of garbage accumulates until they fill a lot and contaminate a lot and good global warming
And how do we do one of their problems is the increased use of plastic.  Example, we see that there is a lot of plastic in the sea.  We have all those turtles, all those little animals that are being affected by so much plastic too.  That is Baz√°n plastic, but there are also many problems, which affect, but here in the waste there is also garbage and papers all that we are throwing away all the waste food waste paper waste all ink from polluting things I was or drinks or  things or bottle many things, in themselves that can pollute a lot and this is the big problem what we should do, it would be that when voting something should be the rubbish, it should be, not just to provide one but a garbage is  for plastic and we all start to use obviously this is already in place, but what I mean is that with very happy more and not be and the company that makes this waste work well again and are clean and all that genre plus the most in general  Why things where they do only in Tutti Frutti those things make it somewhat productive, but here what we could do would be like when you come you finish a bottle the other do the receipts And those people can put it back in some  A use or something that serves so that it does not pollute in block it is filled again without dirt Or also to promote And many companies should start cleaning those bottles so that they can be collected again and that people let them throw them into the sea and thus greatly reduce this pollution since many people would return them a special cleaning and that would make it possible
And you will wonder And that it would not be useful if they continued to create bottles Although they must create bottles Well that they would no longer be lying on the floor or in the sea since they would be putting garbage where they can reuse them Because that would also help since they would be  giving if I use it and they would not be being distributed by many parts or throwing them anywhere where they are attached and what it does is that they contaminate
